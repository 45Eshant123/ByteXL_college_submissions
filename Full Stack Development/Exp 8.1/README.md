# Exp 8.1 - React Login Form (useState)

This small demo shows a login form built with React using the `useState` hook.

Files:
- `public/index.html` - entry HTML that loads React from CDN and mounts the app.
- `src/app.jsx` - React code for `LoginForm` using `useState` for local form state.
- `src/styles.css` - basic styling for the form.

How to run:
1. Open `public/index.html` in a browser (no build required).
2. Type a username and password and press Submit. The entered values will be logged to the console.

Notes:
- This demo uses React and ReactDOM UMD builds and Babel (for JSX) via CDN so you don't need npm/node to run it.
- If you want a packaged project with npm, I can add a `package.json` and Vite/CRA setup.
